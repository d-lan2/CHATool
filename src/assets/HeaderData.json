        "Strict-Transport-Security":"Strict Transport Security enforces the use of HTTPS in the web browser, ensuring that no information is sent for the domain (and optionally subdomains too), even if a link to a plain HTTP page is included or the user unintentionally navigates to a HTTP link. This additionally mitigates the risk of cookies without the secure flag set, by enforcing HTTPS only.",

Thereby the only available options are DENY or SAMEORIGIN. If more granularity is required, consider CSP instead. Preventing framing can prevent Clickjacking attacks."  ,
